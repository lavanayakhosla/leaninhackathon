# TranspareNC



## Overview

TranspareNC is a blockchain-based donation platform designed to bring transparency, accountability, and trust to the donation process. By leveraging blockchain technology, we ensure that every contribution is securely recorded and traceable, giving donors complete confidence that their funds reach the right beneficiaries.

## Problem Statement

- Lack of transparency and accountability in traditional donation systems creates trust issues, making donors hesitant to contribute.
- No unified platform effectively leverages modern technology to seamlessly track donations and ensure funds are utilized properly.

TranspareNC provides a decentralized, immutable, and real-time donation tracking system that:
✅ Ensures complete transparency for donors.
✅ Verifies transactions and fund utilization using blockchain.
✅ Provides real-time impact reports.
✅ Prevents fraud and misuse of donations.
